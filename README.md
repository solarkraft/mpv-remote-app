# mpv-remote-app

Refer to [mcastorina/mpv-remote-app](https://github.com/mcastorina/mpv-remote-app) for info about the original project. 

I'm mostly interested in the included python scripts, less in the app, but I'm hoping to keep the protocol mostly functional. 

### Prerequisite
Have server/server.py running, with a password as parameter
